"""Utility functions for financial calculations used across the TCO application.

This module centralises reusable finance-related maths to avoid code duplication.
All helper functions are intentionally kept free of third-party dependencies
(other than the Python standard library) to ensure they can be imported from
anywhere in the codebase without side-effects.

Functions
---------
npv_constant(annual_cost, discount_rate, years)
    Net present value of a constant annual cash-flow occurring at the end of
    each period.

cumulative_cost_curve(initial_cost, annual_cost, years)
    Simple cumulative cost curve given a one-off up-front expense plus a
    recurring constant annual cost.

price_parity_year(bev_curve, diesel_curve, years=None)
    Year at which two cumulative cost curves intersect (price parity). Uses
    linear interpolation between yearly observations to estimate fractional
    years.

calculate_residual_value(vehicle_data, years, initial_depreciation, annual_depreciation)
    Return the residual value of a vehicle after *years* years.
