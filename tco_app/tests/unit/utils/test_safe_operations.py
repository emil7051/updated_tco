"""Tests for safe operations from Work Package 5.

This module now contains only imports and references to the split test files.
The actual tests have been split into focused files for better organisation:

- test_safe_lookup.py: safe_iloc_zero and safe_lookup_vehicle tests
- test_safe_calculations.py: safe_division and safe_calculate tests
- test_safe_parameters.py: validation and parameter lookup tests
- test_safe_integration.py: integration scenarios tests

This split maintains under 300 lines per file as per global constraints.
