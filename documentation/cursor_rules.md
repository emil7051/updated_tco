Data is stored in /data/tables files, with definitions and usage documented in data/dictionary. 
Always search the codebase for any variables you change or rename to ensure that implementation doesn't introduce inconsistency.
If you update key terms, make sure to also adjust the relevant dictionary entry, data entry, and readme documentation. 
Please avoid duplication - follow clean code, and DRY principles.
