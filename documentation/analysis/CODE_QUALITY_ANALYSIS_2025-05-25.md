# Code Quality Analysis Report - May 25, 2025

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive code quality analysis was performed using Black, Flake8, Vulture, JSCPD, and Radon on the TCO application codebase. The analysis reveals that while significant improvements have been made since the last analysis, there are still areas for refactoring and improvement.

## Metrics Overview

### 1. Code Formatting (Black)
- **Files needing reformatting:** 17 out of 101 Python files (16.8%)
- **Status:** NEEDS ATTENTION ⚠️
- **Impact:** Minor - mostly formatting inconsistencies

### 2. Style Violations (Flake8)
- **Total violations:** 623
  - Line too long (E501): 585 (93.9%)
  - Unused imports (F401): 19 (3.0%)
  - Redefinition of unused variables (F811): 9 (1.4%)
  - Other: 10 (1.6%)
- **Status:** MODERATE ISSUES ⚠️
- **Impact:** Moderate - mostly line length issues

### 3. Dead Code (Vulture)

- **Status:** GOOD ✅
- **Impact:** Minimal - only test variables

### 4. Code Duplication (JSCPD)
- **Duplication rate:** 2.22% (284 lines out of 12,814)
- **Number of clones:** 18
- **Status:** EXCELLENT ✅
- **Impact:** Low - acceptable duplication level

### 5. Code Complexity (Radon)
- **High complexity functions:** 1
  - `ui/pages/sensitivity.py:render` - Cyclomatic Complexity: D (23)
- **Moderate complexity functions:** 21 with B rating (6-10)
- **Status:** NEEDS REFACTORING ⚠️
- **Impact:** High - one function needs urgent refactoring

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Black Formatting Issues

Files requiring formatting (most significant):
```
- tests/unit/domain/test_externalities.py
- ui/builders/charging_builder.py
- ui/summary_displays.py
- tests/unit/domain/test_finance.py
- tests/unit/services/test_scenario_application_service.py
```

**Recommendation:** Run `python3 -m black tco_app/` to automatically fix all formatting issues.

### 2. Flake8 Style Violations

#### Line Length Issues (585 violations)
Most violations are in:
- `ui/summary_displays.py` - 11 violations
- `ui/pages/sensitivity.py` - 2 violations
- Various test files

**Recommendation:** Configure Black with `--line-length 88` (Python's recommended) or refactor long lines.

#### Unused Imports (19 violations)
- Multiple test files importing `unittest.mock.call` but not using it
- Indicates test cleanup opportunities

**Recommendation:** Remove unused imports or use them in tests.

#### Redefinition Issues (9 violations)
- Test fixtures being redefined (e.g., `articulated_bev_vehicle`)
- Indicates potential test organization issues

**Recommendation:** Review test fixtures and consolidate duplicates.

### 3. Vulture Dead Code Analysis

All 6 instances are in test files:
```
- test_externality.py:70: unused variable 'disc_rate'
- test_single_param.py:3: unused import 'call'
- test_single_param.py:207: unused variable 'expected_modifier'
- test_externalities.py:89,124: unused variable 'd'
- test_pages.py:113: unused variable 'kw'
```

**Recommendation:** Clean up test code by removing unused variables.

### 4. JSCPD Code Duplication

Notable duplications:
1. **Test fixtures duplication** (19 lines)
   - `tests/fixtures/vehicles.py` and `tests/integration/test_tco_calculation.py`
   - Consider extracting shared test data

2. **Sensitivity analysis duplication** (11 lines)
   - `domain/sensitivity/single_param.py` and `domain/sensitivity/tornado.py`
   - Candidate for extraction to shared utility

3. **Finance calculation duplication** (10 lines)
   - Within `domain/finance.py` (lines 191-201 and 100-110)
   - Should be refactored to a single method

**Recommendation:** Extract common code to shared utilities.

### 5. Radon Complexity Analysis

#### Critical Complexity (D rating):
- **`ui/pages/sensitivity.py:render`** - Complexity: 23
  - This function is doing too much
  - Should be broken down into smaller functions

#### High Complexity (B rating) - Top concerns:
1. **`services/scenario_application_service.py:VehicleModifier`** - Complexity: 10
2. **`ui/metric_cards.py:display_metric_card`** - Complexity: 9
3. **`services/scenario_application_service.py:VehicleModifier.apply`** - Complexity: 9

**Recommendation:** Refactor high-complexity functions following Single Responsibility Principle.

## Refactoring Priorities

### Priority 1 - Critical (This Week)
1. **Refactor `ui/pages/sensitivity.py:render` function**
   - Break down into smaller, focused functions
   - Extract validation logic
   - Separate UI building from business logic

2. **Apply Black formatting**
   - Run: `python3 -m black tco_app/`
   - Add to pre-commit hooks

### Priority 2 - High (Next Week)
1. **Fix line length violations**
   - Configure IDE to warn at 88 characters
   - Refactor complex expressions

2. **Extract duplicated code**
   - Finance calculations in `domain/finance.py`
   - Test fixtures consolidation
   - Sensitivity analysis utilities

3. **Clean up test code**
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Consolidate duplicate fixtures

### Priority 3 - Medium (Within Month)
1. **Reduce complexity in B-rated functions**
   - Focus on `VehicleModifier` and `display_metric_card`
   - Apply Extract Method refactoring

2. **Improve test organization**
   - Fix redefinition issues
   - Create shared test utilities

## Comparison with Previous Analysis

### Improvements Made ✅
- **Dead code:** Reduced from 54 to 6 instances (89% improvement)
- **Flake8 violations:** Reduced from 3,689 to 623 (83% improvement)
- **Code duplication:** Maintained low level (2.22%)
- **Test coverage:** Increased from 8.79% to 63.57%

### Areas Still Needing Work ⚠️
- **Black formatting:** 17 files still need formatting
- **Line length:** Still 585 violations
- **High complexity:** `sensitivity.py:render` still at D rating

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run Black formatter** on the entire codebase
2. **Refactor `sensitivity.py:render`** into smaller functions
3. **Set up pre-commit hooks** for Black and Flake8

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. **Extract duplicated code** to shared utilities
2. **Clean up test files** - remove unused imports/variables
3. **Configure line length** standards and update code

### Long-term Actions (1 month)
1. **Establish complexity limits** - no function above B rating
2. **Create coding standards** document
3. **Set up CI/CD quality gates** for all metrics

## Conclusion

The codebase has shown significant improvement since the last analysis, with an 83% reduction in style violations and 89% reduction in dead code. The main areas requiring attention are:

1. **Code formatting consistency** - easily fixed with Black
2. **High complexity in sensitivity page** - needs refactoring
3. **Line length violations** - requires standard setting

Overall assessment: **GOOD** with specific areas for improvement. The codebase is maintainable but would benefit from the recommended refactoring to achieve excellent status.
