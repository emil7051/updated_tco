# Watershed TCO - Electric vs. Diesel Truck Comparison Tool

A comprehensive Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) modeling application to compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) with traditional diesel trucks in the Australian context.

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides a detailed economic analysis of electric trucks versus diesel equivalents, helping fleet operators and decision-makers understand the financial implications of transitioning to electric vehicles.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive TCO Analysis**: Compare upfront costs, operational expenses, and long-term economics
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust vehicle types, usage patterns, discount rates, and more
- **Infrastructure Modeling**: Analyze charging infrastructure requirements and costs
- **Emission Calculations**: Quantify COâ‚‚ emission reductions and abatement costs
- **Scenario Analysis**: Pre-defined scenarios for different economic assumptions
- **Visual Comparisons**: Interactive charts and visualizations for easy interpretation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly
- NumPy

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/watershed-tco.git
cd watershed-tco
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r tco_app/requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
